It's truly a great experience. Not only can you increase your understanding about different subjects, you learn how to connect them to each other, and to the world. This is an academic competition. But it's different from other competitions, in that it's probably not even a competition. It is a celebration. Instead of focusing on memorizing facts, WSC is all about applying them and relating them to the world around us you like learning. Before you know it, you'll be asking for more topics to explore.</FONT></TH>

    <font size=5 id='Debatetext'>Debate: World Scholar’s Cup debate is quite simple but fun. You debate with your 2 other teammates, there are 1st speakers, 2nd speakers, 3rd speakers. There will be a motion, judges would pick whether you are positive or negative. The longest amount of time that you can speak is 4 minutes, the judge would hit the table when it reaches 3 minutes. Usually, the first speaker would state 3 points, elaborate on 2 and conclude with a strong statement. The 2nd speaker would elaborate on the 3rd point, rebut the claims that the opposition has made. The 3rd speaker would summarize the team’s points, rebut, and make a strong ending. Good debaters would be confident when they are speaking, as when as being reflective and kind to the opposition.  At the end of the debate, there will be a time for constructive criticism. And the judge would reveal who won. One tip for first time debaters is just to have fun, whether you win or lose. Skills for 1st speakers is to Introduce your stance, Define key terms to your advantage if affirmative, If negative, define terms if the other team didn’t, Outline your points, “In order to win this debate, our opponents must prove...“In order for us to win this debate, we must prove...” Elaborate on one point. Examples Interesting stories. Skills for 2nd speaker: Elaborate on two points,examples, Statistics, Interesting stories, Rebut opponent’s points.Skills for 3rd speaker:restate your points, State what opponents have failed to do and what your team has accomplished, Summarize the opponent’s points and rebut them.</font>

     <font size=5 id='Writingtext'> Writing : Collaborative writing is a like a debate in essay form, like debating, you will have a motion and you can decide whether you agree or disagree. You will have access to the internet for 20 minutes, use this time wisely! And then you will have time to write about your topic. After that, there is 12 minutes to talk to your teammates about the essay. This essay is scored upon how persuasive you are, as long as you are on topic, you can have autonomy of what you want to write about.You’ll be given six statements, each from a different subject area, and asked to choose one to argue for or against. You’ll first have 30 minutes to prepare with your teammates, then an hour by yourself to compose the most persuasive essay possible, then 15 more minutes to work together at the end. Here’s the catch: each member of your team has to choose a different topic.

    <font size=5 id='Challengetext'> Challenge : The scholar’s challenge is like a standardized test pertaining to the Mega Guide each year, scholar’s will have to study the material each year and answer an 120 question test. Scholar’s would have to study extensively for this. Each year the material would change, every year the material is pertaining to the world. it’s multiple choice, so make multiple choices. The Challenge looks like any other test, but with an alpaca-powered twist: you can mark more than one answer per question. The fewer you mark, the more points you can earn if you’re right. (Yes, that means you can finally guess C and D... and also A, B, and E.) Apply your knowledge of the six subjects successfully and you can win medals in one, two, or all of them. You’ll soon discover what all World Scholars do: that even if you think you’re an expert in science, you might win a medal in the arts, and that the best way to prepare for a test that touches on everything is to talk through it all with your team, day by day.Play your cards right, and you could earn enough medals to warrant a neck brace.

 <font size=5 id='challengetext'> Every team in the theater. Every team with a clicker. Every question harder than the one before. Your team will work together to solve analytic questions and multimedia challenges. Click your answers before time runs out, and don’t be surprised if you’re asked to connect a poem you studied to a clip from Game of Thrones. It’s loud. You might even hear a team shout the wrong answer— hoping you’ll click it. It's strategic. What will you and your teammates do when you disagree? Remember, it's not the first team to answer correctly that gets all the credit. You’re all racing the clock. But, the clock is fast and the stakes are high. This challenge is mainly about teamwork, every member of the team will have to contribute, and communicate. Whether you get it right or wrong, it doesn’t matter, the experience matters more.
